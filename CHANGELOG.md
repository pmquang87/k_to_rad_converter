# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Prior history (before this changelog was introduced) is summarized in the
`git log` — each keyword conversion and bug fix landed as its own commit / PR.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Keyword coverage**
  - `*CONSTRAINED_RIGID_BODIES` → a single merged `/RBODY` (slave rigid part's
    nodes fold into the master; chains resolved transitively).
  - `*CONTACT_..._TIEBREAK` (SURFACE_TO_SURFACE / ONE_WAY / TIEBREAK_*) →
    `/INTER/TYPE7` (contact-only; the cohesive pre-bond is warned as dropped).
  - `*DEFINE_CURVE_FUNCTION` → `/FUNCT` by sampling a pure single-variable
    (x/time) expression; parameter/curve/state-referencing expressions are
    warned and skipped.
  - Foam & honeycomb materials: `*MAT_CRUSHABLE_FOAM` (63) → `/MAT/LAW50`,
    `*MAT_LOW_DENSITY_FOAM` (57) → `/MAT/LAW38`, `*MAT_FU_CHANG_FOAM` (83) →
    `/MAT/LAW70`, `*MAT_HONEYCOMB` (26) → `/MAT/LAW28` (confidence levels and
    dropped fields warned per law).
- **Analyses** (offline, riding the modal stiffness-export chain)
  - Linear buckling (`tools/modal_buckling.py`): `K φ = λ(−K_g)φ` for
    beam/rod/truss elements, validated against the analytic Euler column to
    0.001%; shells/solids warned as unsupported.
  - Harmonic / frequency-response (`tools/modal_frf.py`): modal-superposition
    FRF sweep to base or nodal harmonic excitation, validated against the
    closed-form SDOF response.
- **Packaging / DX**
  - `pyproject.toml` with a `k2rad` console entry point and optional
    `[modal]` / `[viz]` / `[all]` / `[dev]` extras.
  - Contributor scaffolding (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, PR/issue templates).
  - Golden-file end-to-end regression fixtures (`tests/fixtures/` +
    `tests/test_golden.py`); coverage gate; advisory mypy; Windows CI leg;
    PyPI publish workflow; Docker bash launchers (`or.sh`, `build-and-export.sh`).

### Changed

- Extracted the TET10 connectivity constant into a neutral `k2rad/topology.py`
  (so the optional `gapmin` path no longer imports the whole writer), and made
  `build_starter` assemble the starter from a data-driven section registry
  (output byte-identical).

### Fixed

- `*LOAD_SEGMENT_SET` pressure loads were silently dropped; now converted to
  `/PLOAD`.
- `*EOS_LINEAR_POLYNOMIAL` now warns when the `C6·μ²·E` term is nonzero (it has
  no `/EOS/POLYNOMIAL` equivalent) instead of ignoring it silently.
